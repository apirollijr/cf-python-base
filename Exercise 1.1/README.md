# Python Course Exercises

This repository contains my work for the Python course. Each exercise has its own folder, and all deliverables (scripts, requirements files, screenshots, and notes) are stored in that folder.

## Structure

- `Exercise 1.1/`
  - `README.md`
  - `add.py`
  - `requirements.txt`
  - `learning-journal.*`
  - screenshots of each step

Additional exercise folders (e.g. `Exercise 1.2`, `Exercise 1.3`, etc.) will be added as I progress through the course.

## For my mentor

I’m organizing my work so that:
- Each exercise lives in its own folder, named `Exercise X.Y`.
- All deliverables specified in the exercise instructions are placed into that folder.
- My learning journal is included in the exercise folder and updated as I progress.
